# Just Anon
- Slash command that provides a form / prompts with instructions for uploading specific files
- Gives those files to me through some anonymizing mechanism that i can still use to ban the user from discord/twitch

## Used to get our silly little audio things
- Prompts for Nya, Woof, and Clap audio telling a person the kind of recording i need
- Grow into the future with stuff like confessionals, etc
